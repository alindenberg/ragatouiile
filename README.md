# Project: Exploring English Football Champions with RAGatouille

This project is designed as a playground for experimenting with the RAGatouille library. The focus of our exploration is the domain of English football champions.
Introduction

RAGatouille is a Python library that simplifies the use and training of state-of-the-art retrieval methods in any Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of data.

In this project, we will be using RAGatouille to train a model on data related to English football champions. This will involve the following steps:

1. Installation: Install the RAGatouille library in your project environment using `pip install ragatouille`

2. Training and Fine-Tuning: Use the built-in TrainingDataProcessor in RAGatouille's RAGTrainer to prepare your data for training. Here is an example of how to prepare your data:

3. Embedding and Indexing Documents: After training, you can use the trained model to embed and index your documents.

4. Retrieving Documents: You can then use the indexed documents to retrieve relevant information based on a given query.

By playing around with the RAGatouille library in this context, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities and potential applications.
